# Python implementation of Techmo TTS gRPC client.

## Docker usage

#### Build docker image

To prepare docker image with Python implementation of tts client, open project's main directory and run:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile-python -t tts-client-python:2.0.0 . 
```
The build process will take several minutes.
When the build process is complete, you will receive a message:
```
Successfully tagged tts-client-python:2.0.0
```

#### Run tts client

To use tts client on a Docker container, go to `tts-client/python/docker` directory and run `run_tts_cilent_python.sh` script.

To send simple request to the TTS service, use:
```
./run_tts_cilent_python.sh --service-address IP_ADDRESS:PORT --text "Sample text to be synthesised"
```

To print list of available options, use:
```
./run_tts_cilent_python.sh --help
```
Output audio files will be created inside `tts-client/python/docker/wav` directory.
Source text files should be placed inside `tts-client/python/docker/txt` directory, if used.

**NOTE:** Unlike a local tts-client instance, the `run_tts_cilent_python.sh` script not allows to set custom paths to input/output files. Instead it uses predefined directories (`wav` and `txt`). When using options: `--input-text-file (-i)` and `--output-file (-o)`, user should provide only filenames.



## Local instance usage

### Basic Usage

TTS Client includes scripts for automatic environment configuration and launching on systems from the Debian Linux family. For launching TTS Client on other Linux-based OS or Windows, check out "Manual Usage" section.


#### Before run

To check required dependencies and prepare virtual environment, run:
```
./setup.sh
```

#### Run

To run TTS Client, use `run.sh` script, e.g.:
```
./run --service-address IP_ADDRESS:PORT --text 'Some text to be synthesized'
```
To print usage description, use:
```
./run --help
```


### Manual Usage

#### Before run

##### Dependencies

If you don't have virtualenv yet, install it first (https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation.html)
To install virtualenv on Ubuntu is enough to use command:

```
sudo apt-get install virtualenv
```

Then install the required dependencies inside the virtual environment (this step only needs to be done the first time, for the further usage it is enough to use the existing virtual environment).


- On Linux:

Use Python 3 with virtual environment and install required packages (supported Python versions are: 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9). 
Inside "tts_client/python" run following commands:

```
virtualenv -p python3 .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For Python 3.5 instead of `requirements.txt` use `requirements_python_3.5.txt`.


- On Windows 10:

Temporarily change the PowerShell execution policy to allow scripting. Start PowerShell with `Run as Administrator` and use command:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
then confirm your choice.

Use Python 3 with virtual environment and install required packages (supported Python versions are: 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9).
Navigate to "tts_client/python" directory and run following commands:

```
virtualenv -p python3.6 .env
.\.env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For Python 3.5 instead of `requirements.txt` use `requirements_python_3.5.txt`.

To switch back PowerShell execution policy to the default, use command:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
```

##### Proto sources

[Optional] To regenerate sources from `.proto`, run:
```
./make_proto.sh
```
This might be required when using other gRPC or Protocol Buffers version.

 

#### Run

To run TTS Client, activate virtual environment first:
- On Linux:
```
source .env/bin/activate
```
- On Windows:
```
.\.env\Scripts\activate
```
Then run TTS Client. Sample use:

```
python tts_client.py -s "192.168.1.1:4321" -f 44100 -t "Polski tekst do syntezy."
```

- `<speak>` - root xml node, with optional `xml:lang` attribute,
- `<prosody>` - supported attributes: `pitch`, `range`, `rate`, and `volume`,
- `<break>` - supported attributes: `strength` and `time`,
- `<emphasis>` - supported attribute: `level`,
- `<say-as>` - supported attribute: `interpret-as` (consult Techmo TTS documentation for the complete list of all available implementations),
- `<lang>` - supported attribute: `xml:lang`,
- `<voice>` - supported attributes: `name`, `gender`, and `age`.

Module:

You can use the client as a module for Python3. Install the package to your environment:
```
pip install -e ./python/.
```
This package provides modules `call_synthesize` and `call_listvoices` with functions with the same name, which run the client. Here are examples how to use them as a module:
```
from call_synthesize import call_synthesize
call_synthesize(args, text)
```
and
```
from call_listvoices import call_listvoices
call_listvoices(args)
```
The `args` are a parsed command line arguments, and `text` is a request text to synthesize (either a plain text or SSML).
Function parameters are described in usage section above.
