# Techmo TTS Service API

Techmo TTS Service API is defined in `proto/TTS.proto` file.

Service's `Synthesize` method accepts `SynthesizeRequest` object which contains whole phrase to be synthesized.
You have to put the phrase as a string in `text` field of `SynthesizeRequest`. The string has to be in orthographic form.
You can set `SynthesizeConfig`'s fields to specify parameters of synthesis. Currently supported option is only `sample_rate_hertz`, which is desired sampling frequency (in hertz) of synthesized audio.

`SynthesizeRequest` can be sent to the service via gRPC insecure channel (that does not require authentication).

`Synthesize` returns synthesized audio in `SynthesizeResponse` as a stream. When reading from the stream you have to check if `SynthesizeResponse` contains `error` field. If it does you can print its `code` and `description`. No `error` field in `SynthesizeResponse` means everything worked fine and its `audio` contains byte `content` that can be appended to received audio samples with `sample_rate_hertz` sampling frequency in hertz. When receiving `SynthesizeResponse` with `audio` you have to check if its `end_of_stream` flag is set to true. When it is set to true it means service has fnished synthesis and you can save your wave file with received synthesized audio content.

We provide sample TTS Client written in:
- C++ in `cpp` (accepts text to be synthesized as a command line string),  
- Python in `python` (accepts text to be synthesized as a command line string or as a content of given text file).  
By default it saves "TechmoTTS.wav" file with received synthesized audio content. To use it, you have to specify provided by us service IP address and port using `--service-address` option with string in form "address:port".

TTS supports following SSML tags:  
`<prosody volume="+40%">text</prosody>`	Change of volume.			Parses numeric value (+ and -)  
`<prosody rate="-10%">text</prosody>`	Change of rate without change of pitch.	Parses numeric value (+ and -)  
`<prosody pitch="+30%">text</prosody>`	Change of pitch.			Parses numeric value (+ and -)  
`<break time="3s"/>`	Inserts silence.					Parses numeric value in seconds or milliseconds ("3s", "750ms")  
Prosody tags can be combined together, example: `<prosody rate="+30%" pitch="+40%">text</prosody>`.
